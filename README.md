This is a React project for the final assesment in Adalab.

In this exercise, I have created an app which extracts data from a the API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters. This API contains info about the different characters in "Rick and Morty" show.

Users can search for characters, filtering them by their name, and click on each card to see more info related to the selected character.
